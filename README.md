About the project

The idea behind this front-end project is to convert the outdated homepage(http://blf.hu) of a basketball team into a modern, clean and responsive design relying on UI/UX. The main goal is to make all parts of the page accessible within no more than two clicks. 
According to different roles in the club there are different kind of accessibility to data.
e.g.: 
Coach —> Full access(CRUD) to the data of his/her own teams.
Player —> Only can modify own information. Get and compare statistics related to matches and 		team members.
Parent —> Get information about the child’s/children’s improvement through the coach’s 			feedbacks. 
Admin —> Full control of all CRUD actions through the database. Verifying registration by 			connecting player profiles with user profiles.
