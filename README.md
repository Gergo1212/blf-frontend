About the project

The idea behind this front-end project is to convert the outdated homepage(http://blf.hu) of a basketball team into a modern, clean and responsive design relying on UI/UX. The main goals are to make all parts of the page accessible within no more than two clicks and provide a platform for coaches on which they can add/modify data related to the club. Such as matches, seasons, statistics, etc. Furthermore giving the opportunity for players to registration and account creation.

The roles will have the following accessibilities:

•	Admin —> Full control of CRUD actions through the database. Verifying registration by 		connecting player profiles with user profiles.

•	Coach —> Full access(CRUD) for the data of his/her own teams.

•	Player —> Can modify only his/her own information. Get and compare statistics related to 		matches and team members.

•	Parent —> Get information about the child’s/children’s improvement through the coach’s 		feedbacks. 

Version

The project is still under development. Remaining parts, for instance registration, email sending, and filling up the sub menus with content related to the club, will be implemented in subsequent sprints.
